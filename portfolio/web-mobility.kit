							<h3>AT&T Multimedia Solutions site redesign</h3>

							<p>The site serves several purposes: it showcases the quality of our work and the breadth of services we offer, provides access to  and tutorials for several self-service tools, collects information to open new projects, and provides clients status updates on their open projects. All project information is handled by a database backend, which we retained.</p>

							<h3>AT&T 2014 Industry Analyst Summit webapp</h3>
							<p class="deck">The Challenge: Deploy a companion webapp for a major corporate event, the annual Industry Analyst Summit. The app was to be pre-installed onto a mobile device provided to attendees.</p>
							<p>In previous years, the company had contracted outside developers to build a native app, but (inevitable) changes were slow to implement, and the overall cost was prohibitive. So last year, we were tasked with building a webapp and supporting backend, saving the client considerable time and budget, while still providing an excellent experience for both attendees and the client team.</p>
							<!--
							<p>The webapp features two logins, one for attendees and one for AT&T speakers and staff. It provides each attendee with a customized event schedule, with detailed information for each session; lists of attendees, which can be filtered by company; a list of speakers, with their speaking schedules and bios; feedback surveys for each session as well as the event as a whole, and helpful information such as the weather, area map, transportation and lodging options, and more.</p>
							-->
							<p>The backend was outsourced to our usual database vendor, but I did the entire frontend development, from concept to comps through to code. In addition, I designed the app based on the new – at the time unfinished – corporate brand design guidelines. Not only did I succeed, but the Brand organization highlighted the AS14 app as an example of how to implement the new guidelines properly.</p>

							<h3>“AT&T 3.0” Compliant intranet site template</h3>
							<p class="deck">The Challenge: Develop a brand-approved template for intranet websites, based on all-new – but incomplete – corporate design standards.</p>
							<!--
							<p>The AT&T Client Executive (ACE) Partners Program matches up AT&T senior executives with the sales reps of major customer accounts to help close major deals.</p>
							<p>But that’s not why I’m featuring this site. It was actually the first of a “family” of intranet sites I built.</p>
							-->
							<p>AT&T’s brand identity has gone through several major changes over the last few years. Typically, new brand guidelines focus on customer-facing communications; intranet site design, on the other hand, has a very low priority.</p>
							<p>In this case, months after the biggest shift in branding to date, there was still no design guidance for websites, while I had a backlog of clients who needed sites. So, I decided to force the issue; I designed and build this site, implementing what guidelines we did have – a new palette of colors and gradients, new custom fonts, a group of shape elements – and submitted it to brand review. After a few rounds of back-and-forth, they approved it, and I finally had an officially blessed site template. It became the basis for about a dozen intranet sites over the next two years, each customized with unique graphics and minor changes to the color palette.</p>
