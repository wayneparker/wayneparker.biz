							<p class="deck">The Challenge: Develop a series of eye-catching, animated annual award announcements.</p>
							<p>Sell to Excel is a sales reward program for AT&T’s Premier Client Group, their biggest customers. The top salespeople each year win a trip to a far-off city and top-shelf accommodations.</p>
							<p>The announcements had been done via email, but a few years ago our client wanted something with more impact, so I worked with our creative director to come up with a dynamic Flash animation. Subsequent animations were based on the initial design, but with unique photos, graphics and soundtrack to keep them fresh. The client would provide photos of the destination and venue, and my C.D. would choose from them, design some unique graphic flourishes, and create a <a href="img/selltoexcel/1h13-chicago-storyboard.jpg" class="fancybox" title="Sell to Excel (Flash) storyboard">storyboard</a> for the client to review. Once approved, I’d modify the previous year’s animation with the new photos and graphics; keeping the “bones” of the animation consistent saved quite a bit of production time.</p>

							<p class="deck">The Challenge: Modify the successful Sell to Excel animation series to be compatible with company-issued iPads.</p>
							<p>The original series of Sell to Excel animations were a big hit, but as the sales force transitioned to iPads en masse, we could no longer rely on Flash. For a couple of years, we recorded the Flash animation to H.264 video for iPad compatibility, but the client wanted a single version for all devices. The company had <em>finally</em> upgraded the standard desktop browser from IE6, so I could now take advantage of modern in-browser animation techniques like CSS3/jQuery animation.</p>
							<p>I worked with my creative director on a new design and <a href="img/selltoexcel/1h14-html5-storyboard.jpg" class="fancybox" title="Sell to Excel (CSS/jQuery) storyboard">storyboard</a> that resembled previous announcements, but with new technical limiations in mind. Animation using JavaScript calls is a lot less natural than working with a visual timeline, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly, and the client loved the final product.</p>

							<h3>Service Excellence Award announcements</h3>
							<p class="deck">The Challenge: Create a series of dynamic, engaging quarterly award announcements, with a different theme for each year.</p>
							<p>Similar to the Sell to Excel announcements in that there was a common theme, but different in that the theme, and hence the entire animation, changed each year. Themes included “Space” (stars, comets, planets, the sun), “Music” (classical, rock, jazz, blues), “Amazing” (based on a sales campaign slogan; amazing nature, amazing creations, amazing microscopic details, etc.), and my favorite, “Olympics” in 2012 (swimming, gymnastics, track & field, ice skating).</p>
							<p>In addition to the text and photo animation, these included <a href="img/sea/winners.jpg" class="fancybox">lists of the winners’ names</a>, grouped by organization, making them fairly content-heavy.</p>

							<h3>ATT.com Marquee: Voice Transformation, Take 1</h3>
							<p class="deck">The Challenge: Develop an animated “marquee” graphic for ATT.com illustrating AT&T’s Voice Transformation initiative.</p>
							<p>Voice Transformation was all about integrating many of AT&T’s voice services under a common platform. The client suggested a theme of “putting together all the pieces of the puzzle,” which I took and ran with. I found a cool stock photo of a globe made up of puzzle pieces (AT&T loves globes!), and I had my concept. I put it together in a detailed <a href="img/marquee/puzzle-storyboard.jpg" class="fancybox" title="Voice Transformation marquee storyboard">detailed storyboard</a>, which the client signed off on immediately.</p>

Transforming a strongly vertical infographic to fit a strongly horizontal marquee was a challenge, but I broke the original artwork down into <a href="img/marquee/update-storyboard.jpg" class="fancybox" title="Voice Transformation storyboard, revisited">a few “scenes” that fit the format</a>, imitating the infographic’s “arrow” element to ease the flow between the scenes, and animating the elements of each scene so that they “built” as they told the story.</p>
